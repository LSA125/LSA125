### Hi there 👋

🔍 I'm all about the nitty-gritty of programming, especially when it comes to low-level languages like C++ and C. From squeezing out every bit of performance to optimizing algorithms, I'm all in for the challenge.

💻 But hey, I'm not just a low-level wizard! I also love the flexibility of Java and Python. Whether it's building sturdy back-end systems or scripting cool apps, I'm all about making things work seamlessly.

⚙️ I'm chasing my dream of becoming a back-end engineer, though I do dabble in front-end development when its needed.
