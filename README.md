### Hi there 👋

🔍 I'm all about the nitty-gritty of programming, especially when it comes C++ and C. I love squeezing the performance out of my programs, even when I have to delve into the world of x86 assembly to make sure the program is cmov-ing and not cmp-jumping.

💻 As much as I love low level programming, Java, Javascript, and Python are my go to languages when it comes to making real-world applications.

⚙️ I'm chasing my dream of becoming a back-end engineer, though I do dabble in Angular for my front-ends.
